# 💊 Pharmacy Sticker Printing System

A Windows Forms desktop application designed for pharmacies to generate and print customized dosage instruction stickers. It supports dynamic layouts, barcode generation, and smart input handling to ensure accurate, readable, and professional sticker output.

## 📌 Features

### 🖨️ Sticker Printing
- Print-ready layout using the `PrintDocument` class.
- Utilizes GDI+ for accurate positioning and rendering.
- Real-time sticker preview within the app.

### ✏️ Custom Text & Presets
- Add dosage instructions manually or via dropdowns:
  - Dosage
  - Timing
  - Duration
  - Frequency
- Auto-formats and appends selections to a single text block.

### 📏 Text Fitting Logic
- Dynamically measures text size to fit within sticker dimensions.
- Prevents overflow using auto-truncation.
- Ensures all printed content stays within visible boundaries.

### 🖼️ Logo Support
- Adds a centered pharmacy logo on the sticker.
- Configurable size and placement.


### 🧠 Smart Layout & Centering
- All content (logo, text, barcode) is centered both vertically and horizontally.
- Prevents misalignment during printing.

### 📝 Input Validation
- Limits custom text box input to fit within the printable area.
- Uses `Graphics.MeasureString` to enforce fitting logic in real-time.
